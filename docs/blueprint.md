# **App Name**: Quadslator

## Core Features:

- Prompt Input: Input field (textarea) for users to enter the text prompt they want to translate.
- Context Input: Textarea for providing context for translation. Should be slightly smaller than the translation button.
- Saved Contexts: Dropdown menu to display saved contexts from local storage.
- Save Context: Functionality to save a new context to local storage, including a field for the context name.
- AI Translation: AI-powered tool to generate four unique translations of the given prompt, considering the provided context.
- Translation Display: Display the 4 unique translations in a clear format on the page.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#00BFFF) to convey a sense of technological innovation and linguistic connection.
- Background color: Light cyan (#E0FFFF), very desaturated, to provide a clean and unobtrusive backdrop that keeps focus on the content.
- Accent color: Violet (#8A2BE2), providing a pop of visual interest analogous to deep sky blue that highlights important interactive elements such as the Translate button.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for a modern, machined, objective and neutral look that works well for both.
- Use simple, clean icons to represent different languages and save/load actions.
- Prioritize a clean and intuitive layout with clear sections for input, context, saved contexts, and translation results.
- Subtle animations when switching between saved contexts and displaying new translations to give feedback to the user.
